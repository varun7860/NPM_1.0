# NPM_1.0
![node_graph](npm/Implementation/single_gripper.png)

NPM is a Non - Prehensile Manipulator I have built in ROS for Pushing and Flattening piles. This project based on an environment which consists of Table, a pile of boxes resting on the table, Kinect Camera mounted parallel to the table and the Scara Manipulator. The main aim in the project is to flatten the pile as fast as possible with the help of robotic arm and the depth camera without the boxes falling off the table.

## Problem Description
In the municipal waste recycling industry, recyclables are not pre-sorted and are sent to a Material Recovery Facility (MRF) for sorting. Laborers at conveyor belts will separate desired materials from undesired materials. Working conditions are unpleasant and tedious.Sorting the pile of waste is not easy and takes lots of time. A solution should be developed which will aim to automate certain aspects of sorting the pile of waste.
